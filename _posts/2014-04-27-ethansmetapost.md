i had the opportunity to go to three completely different meetups. the first meetup was an open meeting at splatspace. 
i went to their headquarters in durham, heard what they were all working on, talked to some of the guys, and got a tour of everything that was going on.
the second meetup i went to was NSCoder Night - Durham/Chapel Hill - Weekly Hack Night. this was a very laid back atmosphere at a bar. 
the third meetup i went to was a bunch of college students doing some coding for class. very very different than the other two. 

i have a couple of key take aways from going to these meetups. 

one of the biggest ones is that coders can all be very different. going in, i thought that all legit coders were going to be really nerdy.
going into these meetups and coming out having a normal conversation with people and then being able to talk about what they were working on was really cool. 
it's really taught me to not going in with expectations. expectations will only get me in trouble in these sorts of situations. 

one of the other key take aways is that you don't have to be getting paid to be working on something really cool. 
some of the people that i went and met up with were working on projects just for fun. one of the guys at the NSCoders Night had created an app for soccer refs.
he did that for fun. not really to make a ton of money. but then the students were having to do it becasue they were required to for class. a little different atmosphere. 

and i guess my last observation is that coding can actualy be fun. these people were having fun. they had created communities of like people and were just coding for fun.
if you can find something that you can do with a friend, why not? 

anyways, i actually really enjoyed going to meetups.
